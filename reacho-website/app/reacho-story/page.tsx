                It all started with a simple question:{" "}
                <span className="italic">
                  "Do you guys have plans to build a customer support suite
                  for eCommerce?"

                At first, we thought it was just a one-off request. But the
                questions kept coming in. As the team behind EngageBay, used
                by over 200,000 businesses, we couldn't help but wonder why
                eCommerce brands were so eager for another customer support
                tool. After all, thereâ€™s already plenty out there, with
                Gorgias leading the way. What were we missing?
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium text-xl py-3">
                Perspective
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                When the truth hit us, it was shocking: eCommerce brands are
                spending thousands of dollars{" "}
                <span className="italic">every single month</span> for
                customer support software with a few built-in automations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base py-3">
                That's daylight robbery! ðŸ˜…
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 pb-3">
                It didnâ€™t take long for us to decide. We got our best
                engineers together, gave them all the resources they needed
                (yes, including Ramen!), and started building Reacho from the
                ground up. After weeks of testing, it became clear that it was
                time for the legacy systems to make way for something better.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 py-3">
                <span className="font-medium text-base">
                  Why is Reacho free?
                </span>{" "}
                Because no business should be forced to pay for customer
                support software. EngageBay always provided free customer
                support tools, but Reacho is built exclusively for eCommerce
                stores â€” and it will stay free forever.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 py-3">
                Weâ€™ve built it with the same depth as some of the top tools
                out there like Gorgias, minus all the costly extras. Sure, we
                donâ€™t have every integration yet, but weâ€™re working on it,
                burning the midnight oil to make Reacho even better.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 pt-3">
                So, why pay for something that should be free? Give Reacho a
                try, and let us know what you think. We built it for you,
                after all. ðŸ™‚
